          In a commanding display, India took a formidable 1-0 lead in the ODI
          series against South Africa at the Wanderers. Opting to bat first,
          South Africa faced a relentless Indian pace attack led by Arshdeep
          Singh, who claimed a remarkable five-wicket haul. Avesh Khan provided
          crucial support, dismissing the hosts for just 116 runs within 28
          overs.

        ></script>
        <p>
          The Proteas faced early setbacks as Reeza Hendricks departed for a
          duck, dragging Arshdeep onto his stumps. Rassie van der Dussen
          followed suit, falling for a golden duck. Despite Tony de Zorzi's
          counterattack, Arshdeep continued to wreak havoc, claiming his fourth
          wicket by dismissing Heinrich Klaasen. Avesh Khan joined the party,
          taking two quick wickets, reducing South Africa to 52/6.

          David Miller's tame shot and Andile Phehlukwayo's fighting 33 were not
          enough to revive the innings. Arshdeep Singh completed his five-wicket
          haul as South Africa crumbled for 116.

          In response, India chased the modest target with ease, losing Ruturaj
          Gaikwad early but showcasing a dominant performance. Debutant Sai
          Sudharsan impressed with a composed half-century, becoming the 17th
          Indian to achieve the feat on debut. Shreyas Iyer, too, made a brisk
          start, smashing boundaries as India comfortably reached 117/2 in 16.4
          overs.
